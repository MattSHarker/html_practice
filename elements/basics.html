<!-- A basic program to demonstrate how elements work -->
<!-- Open the file in a web browser -->

<!-- Elements start and end with tags  -->
<em>This is italicized text</em>

<!-- Elements can be nested inside others as well -->
<p>I am <strong>very</strong> hungry</p>



<!-- Some tags are Block and some are Inline -->
<!-- inline -->
<em>inline_</em><em>style_</em><em>tags</em>

<!-- block-level -->
<p>block_</p><p>style_</p><p>tags</p>



<!-- some elements are only a single tag, know as Empty Elements or Void Elements -->

<!-- commented out due to physical size -->


<!-- Elements can also have attributes -->
<p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>
    <!--
        Attributes should have: 
            1: a space between it and the element name (or previous attribute is multiple)
            2: The attribute name followed by an equal sign
            3: An attribute value enclosed in quotation marks
        
        Attributes contain extra info about the element that doesn't appear in the content
    -->

<!-- anchor <a> tag -->
<!-- turns the encased text into a hyperlink -->
<p> Here's an anime 
    <a href="https://i.redd.it/5sjnvcbsc9r21.jpg"

    target="_blank">programmer_irl</a>
    meme that I like

    <!-- Common attributes:
            href: creates a hyperlink to a specified web address
            title: displayed specified info when a link is 
            target: specifies the browsing context to be used to display the link
                target="_blank" opens content in new tab
                omitting this attribute opens the link in the current page
    -->



<!-- Boolean attributes are attributes written without values -->

<!-- disabled input text box -->
<input type="text" disabled="disabled">

<!-- enabled input text box -->
<input type="text">



<!-- Omitting quotes around attribute values -->
    <!-- In some scenarios, quotations can be left off values, but it is better 
         practice to always have them -->
    <!-- Double quotes and single quotes do the exact same thing, but they do
         not mix, double always go with double, single always with single -->
